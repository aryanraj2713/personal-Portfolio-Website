## Problem Analysis

### 1. Keyword Conflict

The term "OPC" has different meanings in different markets:

| Market               | "OPC" Meaning                           |
| -------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| English (Industrial) | OPC UA - Industrial automation protocol |
| Chinese              | 一人公司 (One Person Company)           |
| Solopreneur          | One Person Company (intended meaning)   |

**Decision:** Focus on long-tail keywords for English market:

- "AI agent skills for solopreneurs"
- "Claude Code skills"
- "indie hacker tools"

### 2. Missing Schema Markup

No structured data meant:

- No rich results in Google
- Poor AI visibility
- No FAQ display

### 3. No GEO Optimization

Content lacked:

- Statistics and data points
- Expert citations
- FAQ format
- Answer-first structure
